When checking right hand side of vapp with expected type
        Vect (S len + m) a

When checking argument xs to constructor Data.Vect.:::
        Type mismatch between
                Vect (len + len) a (Type of vapp xs xs)
        and
                Vect (plus len m) a (Expected type)
        
        Specifically:
                Type mismatch between
                        plus len len
                and
                        plus len m

When checking right hand side of with block in Main.parity with expected type
        Parity (S (S (j + j)))

Type mismatch between
        Parity (S j + S j) (Type of Even)
and
        Parity (S (S (plus j j))) (Expected type)

Specifically:
        Type mismatch between
                plus (S j) (S j)
        and
                S (S (plus j j))
